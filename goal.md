# Project Goal

## Objective
Rewrite the raylet in ray (the repo is in the work directory) from C++ to Rust, incrementally using FFI until the whole raylet can be finally converted to Rust. Make sure to test the new rust code.

## Key Requirements
- Raylet is written in Rust
- FFI is allowed until this is finally completed

## Out of Scope
- Do not convert other areas to Rust (you may modify them to work with any new FFI interfaces if required)
